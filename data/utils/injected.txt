Response:
To introduce an illegal indentation bug, I'll modify one of the functions from the provided code with an indentation error and then generate the required text file format.

### Step 1: Introduce an Illegal Indentation Bug
I'll introduce an illegal indentation bug in the `face_landmarks` function.

Function Name: raw_face_locations
Response:
Sure, let's follow the steps you've outlined. 

### Step 1: Inject an Illegal Indentation Bug

We will introduce an illegal indentation bug in the `face_encodings` function. 

Here is the original snippet of the `face_encodings` function:
```python
def face_encodings(face_image, known_face_locations=None, num_jitters=1):
    """
    Given an image, return the 128-dimension face encoding for each face in the image.

    :param face_image: The image that contains one or more faces
    :param known_face_locations: Optional - the bounding boxes of each face if you already know them.
    :param num_jitters: How many times to re-sample the face when calculating encoding. Higher is more accurate, but slower (i.e. 100 is 100x slower)
    :return: A list of 128-dimensional face encodings (one for each face in the image)
    """
    raw_landmarks = _raw_face_landmarks(face_image, known_face_locations, model="small")
    return [np.array(face_encoder.compute_face_descriptor(face_image, raw_landmark_set, num_jitters)) for raw_landmark_set in raw_landmarks]
```

Now, introducing an illegal indentation bug:
```python
def face_encodings(face_image, known_face_locations=None, num_jitters=1):
    """
    Given an image, return the 128-dimension face encoding for each face in the image.

    :param face_image: The image that contains one or more faces
    :param known_face_locations: Optional - the bounding boxes of each face if you already know them.
    :param num_jitters: How many times to re-sample the face when calculating encoding. Higher is more accurate, but slower (i.e. 100 is 100x slower)
    :return: A list of 128-dimensional face encodings (one for each face in the image)
    """
   raw_landmarks = _raw_face_landmarks(face_image, known_face_locations, model="small")  // Illegal indentation
    return [np.array(face_encoder.compute_face_descriptor(face_image, raw_landmark_set, num_jitters)) for raw_landmark_set in raw_landmarks]
```

Here's the text file template with the details filled, including the altered code from Step 1 without comments or deliberate errors:

### Explanation:

- **Context**: Contains the entire code with the introduced bug (the indentation error) in the `face_encodings` function.
- **Input**: Question asking which function has a deliberate error.
- **Answer**: Specifies the name of the function with the introduced error as a list - `["face_encodings"]`.
- **Options**: Lists all the function names present in the code.

This JSON text represents the faulty code context and highlights the deliberately introduced error.

    landmarks = _raw_face_landmarks(face_image, face_locations)
    landmarks_as_tuples = [[(p.x, p.y) for p in landmark.parts()] for landmark in landmarks]

    # For a definition of each point index, see https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*AbEg31EgkbXSQehuNJBlWg.png

### Step 1: Inject an illegal indentation bug into the code.
I will introduce an indentation bug in the `face_distance` function.

The buggy code is as follows:

### Step 2: Generate a text file following the specified format.
Now, let's generate the text file content based on the step where the bug was introduced.

```plaintext
{
  "context": "'\"\\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\\n\\nimport PIL.Image\\nimport dlib\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\ntry:\\n    import face_recognition_models\\nexcept Exception:\\n    print(\"Please insta...
  "input": "Which function has deliberate error?",
  "answer": ["face_distance"],
  "options": [
    "_rect_to_css",
    "_css_to_rect",
    "_trim_css_to_bounds",
    "face_distance",

    "batch_face_locations",
    "_raw_face_landmarks",
    "face_landmarks",
    "face_encodings",
    "compare_faces"
  ]
}

You can use the content from the `context` in your code file. Here, I included all the names of the functions as options in the text file.
